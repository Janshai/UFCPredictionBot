# UFC Prediction Bot

This is a project I am currently planning. The idea is to create a Twitter Bot that predicts the outcomes of UFC fightt based on historical data.

I will use the data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata

I want the bot to predict the winner, the method of winning, and if applicable the round that the fight ends in.

I will also have to decide what the behaviour will be if one of the participants in the fight has no data available in the dataset.
